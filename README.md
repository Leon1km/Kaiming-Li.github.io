## `Research Experiences`
_Advisor: Prof. Xi Chen_ [_`Details→`_](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xi_Chen32)

The roles of particular microRNAs and siRNAs in the tumorigenesis, development and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). Therapy to treat ulcerative colitis based a novel delivery system of mTOR siRNA.

“Free From Fat”: Targeted exosome-mediated delivery of Bcl-2 siRNA for treatment of obesity. Based on this project, our team NJU-China won a silver medal in iGEM 2017 Competition (International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition).

Currently studying the functions of noncoding RNAs including microRNAs and siRNAs in cell-cell communication and crosskingdom regulation between plant and animal.

My work involves biological experiments both in vitro and in vivo such as cell culture, transfection, qRT-PCR, western blotting and mouse experiments. In addition, I have improved the ability to combine bioinformatic techniques such as the use of databases and software with lab experiments to design projects and analyze data and results. (`Oct. 2016-present`)
